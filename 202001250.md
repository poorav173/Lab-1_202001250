# Q1. The following are the functional and non-functional requirements:-


# Functional requirements: 
These are the specifications that the end user expects as a minimum set of features. The functional requirements for the Library Information System will be as follows:

1.Simple Access:

Based on the title, author, release date, and other criteria, the user should be able to quickly locate the book they need.
keeping track of the books the user has accessed and updating the information to reflect his most recent activities
updating the data.

The books can be readily added or removed by the librarian depending on the needs.
if there is no other demand for the identical book, allowing the user to extend the due date.
Reminder that is past due:

If users don't return the book by the specified date, they are alerted.

# Non-functional prerequisites:
These are the requirements for quality that the system must meet.

1.Security:

Users' personal information ought to stay in the library's system and not leave it.
to make certain that the books issued are correctly returned within the allotted time.

2.Reliability:

Given that the system contains a vast amount of data, it should be able to be trusted.

3.Performance:

Requests issued to the system should receive suitable responses from it.
Both staff and users should have a seamless, lag-free experience when using the system.

4.Scalability:

When necessary, the system need to be able to grow its user base and accommodate additional users.
If there are numerous libraries, the data should be scalable and kept in a database such that it is accessible from each library.

# Q2. The following are the scope, functional and non-functional requirements:

1.Scope:

Designing a system that can detect loud noises and promptly notify the user as a result.
Controlling: To begin, we offer a basic system design. The design is then put into practise to create a real working system. Depending on the results, we might or might not take the changes into account.
In conclusion, we compare our finished system to the one we had originally planned to design.

# Functional prerequisites:

being able to hear loud noises.
based on the sounds, alerting the user.
The user is alerted with little to no delay.
AI is capable of identifying sounds such as baby crying, automobile horns, etc.

# Non-functional prerequisites:

1.Reliability:

The system must be reliable in sending users alerts at the appropriate times.

2.Security;


Users' private information must be kept secure within the system.

3.Performance:

The system should be highly effective in that it provides the user with precise alerts.
Only when necessary, and not in response to every sound heard, the system should notify the user.

4.Scalability:

We must try to scale the system to each individual in order to ensure their safety and security, as it has been stated that approximately 5% of the world's population suffers from hearing loss.
